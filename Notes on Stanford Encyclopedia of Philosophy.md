## 0. Intro:

Normative business ethics:
What is ethical and unethical in business?

## 1. Variaties of business:
### Assumptions:	
1. the means of production can be privately owned 
2. A second is that markets—featuring voluntary exchanges between buyers and sellers at mutually determined prices—should play an important role in the allocation of resources

## 2. Corporate moral agency:
Whether firms are moral agents and morally responsible considered as (qua) firms, not considered as aggregates of individual members of firms?
French (1979,1984): “full-fledged” moral persons. Differ from moral agents. 

## 3. Corporate governance: the end and means of
About who firms should be managed for, and who should (ultimately) manage them.

### 3.1 Shareholder primacy (first end)
Dominant in financial professionals and in business schools.
1. deontological
2. consequentialist 

### 3.2 Stakeholder theory (second end theory)
By Freeman in the 1980s.

Instead of managing the firm in the best interests of shareholders only, managers should seek to “balance” the interests of all stakeholders, where a stakeholder is anyone who has a “stake”, or interest (including a financial interest), in the firm.

To its critics, stakeholder theory has seemed both insufficiently articulated and weakly defended.
1. Who are the stakeholders? No clear rationale.
2. What does it mean to 'balance'? 

**Managers should act within a ethic permissible domain to get to these ends**
