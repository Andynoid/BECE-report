# Is stakeholder theory a theory of normative ethics? Does it help us explain our "moral intuitions" in the context of business activity?

Stakeholder theory states that the business needs to consider the interests of stakeholders, where the stakeholders are person or groups that can be affected by the firm. Since the Edward Freeman and his book *Strategic management*, stakeholder theory has attracted the attention of many academics in philosophy, corporate strategy, and business management. Is stakeholder theory a theory of normative ethics? This is a theoretical debate that is still on going. My answer to the question is yes. Stakeholder theory have may normative theory supports and itself fits into a framework of normative ethics. With real life examples, I will also show that stakeholder theory is coincident with our moral intuitions, such as the pursue of fairness, democracy and mutual respect.  

Stakeholder theory is a developing theory. Freeman first proposed the stakeholder theory as an alternative to the traditional shareholder theory which states that the firm should be managed in the interest of its shareholders only **(2)**.  Notice the theory was proposed as a new strategy aiming a better performance of the company. Frederick noted it as "The stakeholder idea fits into the mentality of strategically-minded corporate managers... not for normative reasons but for strategic purposes." **(3)** During 1991 to 1998, many influencial publication was made about the theory, and the theory thus embraced a fast development. Among these publications, Donaldson and Preston made a taxonomy of the then greatly developed stakeholder theory. They states that the theory contains three branches: the descriptive, the normative, and the instrumental stakeholder theory.**(4)** Descriptive and instrumental stakeholder theory discuss how the firm behave and how the the behaviour affects its performance, respectively. The normative stakeholder theory focus on how the firms should behave, i.e. the means of a business. The first argument of this report clearly falls into the normative stakeholder theory domain. 

To discuss wether stakeholder is a normative theory, we must know what it takes to be a normative theory. John D. Bishop's compared three normative ethics theory and proposed a framework of normative ethics.  **(8)**. The framework contains seven parts. Bishop states that for an adequate normative theory, it should have clear definition for all seven parts. In the following paragraph, I shall follow this framework to show that stakeholder theory in this sense, is indeed a normative theory.

The fist part of the framework is the fundamental moral principles that the theory builds on, in short, values. What fundamental moral principle does stakeholder theory builds on? It is the respect of human rights, fairness and mutual consent. The theory especially..

The second part is the basis of values. 

The third part of the framework is decision principle. This part requires normative theory to have a practical guide for actions and policies. This is a particularly big challenge for the stakeholder theory.

The fourth part is the agents. Who is the agent to use the decision principle? In the co

Many people has sought many other normative ethics to support stakeholder theory. The concept of mediation from feminist ethics has been brought into the theory . **(7)** The author states that, by introducing a neutral, third party mediator, the inevitable divergent of interest between stakeholders can be solved efficiently. The example of Heinz dilemma can be thus integrated as conflict between the firm and costume. In the dilemma, Heinz tried to steal an expensive drug that he can not afford to save his wife's life. Heinz stealing drug would solve his problem but also raise dispute with the druggist. Alternatively, by a mediation between Heinz and the drug dealer, something else maybe agreed between Heinz and the druggist. This later method is believed to be more feminine. Following this principle, through mediation, stakeholders may have an agreement on business issues. 
Another normative theory that has been used to support stakeholder theory is the principle of fairness. Fairness among the stakeholders is an important issue and according to Harry **(8)** , consent is the solution to it. Fairness is an emotive term because it is people that can feel either fair or unfair as an emotion. The principle of fairness requires the manager of the firm to treat all stakeholders fairly including those powerless stakeholders. Although exploiting the powerless stakeholders may not bring negative effect to the firm. The principle of fairness suggest there's an ethical issue in doing so because these stakeholders have being treated unfairly. To act ethically, the firm should receive consent from these powerless stakeholders. Based on the idea of consent, Harry bring up a reconstructed principle of fairness that participates in the corporative governance. Thus bring the principle of fairness into the stakeholder theory. However, such theory has problem dealing with environment. While environment is powerless, it's meaningless to speak of the consent of the environment. Although whether environment is a stakeholder is still in debate, this is one situation that the principle of fairness may fail. 
Other normative frameworks have also been used, such as the common good, critical theory, Aristotelian ethics and many more. **(5)** However, criticisms also exists. As early in 1984, Freeman himself states that "the stakeholder theory it is not normative in the sense that it prescribes particular positions of moral worth to the actions of managers". Despite the efforts of many academics thereafter, Humber criticised that "the attempt to develop a 'special' moral theory for use by business is impractical and should be abandoned". Such opinion can be opposed by the coincidence between stakeholder theory and our moral intuitions, which I will discuss later in the essay. Furthermore, Frederick criticised "...(stakeholder theory) has encouraged business ethics philosophers ... to pile up on theory after theory of which are irrelevant to the needs at hand." While I personally consider this criticism didn't point at the normative foundation of stakeholder ethics. It rather states that there are many more urgent issues in the instrumental and descriptive stakeholder ethics.





 

One must also understand that, as a developing theory, stakeholder theory is far from complete. More questions about the theory will be raised while existing criticisms will be answered by future theoretical and empirical research.
