# Is stakeholder theory a theory of normative ethics? Does it help us explain our "moral intuitions" in the context of business activity?

Stakeholder theory claims that the business needs to consider the interests of stakeholders, where the stakeholders are person or groups that can be affected by the firm. Since the Edward Freeman and his book *Strategic management*, stakeholder theory has attracted the attention of many academics in philosophy, corporate strategy, and business management. It certainly is a theory of normative ethics. However, one must understand that stakeholder theory can be applied to a very broad range of context, and is even criticised by because of its broad domain (1). The theory itself is still developing and far from complete.
