By Freeman in the 1980s.

Instead of managing the firm in the best interests of shareholders only, managers should seek to “balance” the interests of all stakeholders, where a stakeholder is anyone who has a “stake”, or interest (including a financial interest), in the firm.

To its critics, stakeholder theory has seemed both insufficiently articulated and weakly defended.

2. What does it mean to 'balance'? 

**Managers should act within a ethic permissible domain to get to these ends**
